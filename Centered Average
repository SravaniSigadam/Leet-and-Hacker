# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and
# smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. 
# Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.

# Input: centered_average([-10, -4, -2, -4, -2, 0]) Output: -3
