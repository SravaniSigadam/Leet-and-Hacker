#You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.

#Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. 
#If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.

# Input: nums = [3,6,1,0] Output: 1
# Explanation: 6 is the largest integer. For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x. The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.


class Solution:

        max_num = max(nums)
        for i in nums:
            if i != max_num:
                if 2*i > max_num: 
                    return -1
        return nums.index(max_num)
