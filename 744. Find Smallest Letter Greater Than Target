# Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, 
# return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

# Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a" Output: "c"

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        letters_length = len(letters)
        low = 0
        high = letters_length - 1

        if target < letters[low] or target >= letters[high]:
            return letters[low]

        while low <= high:
            middle =  (low + high) // 2
            candidate = letters[middle]
            
            if target < candidate: 
                high = middle - 1
            
			
            if target >= candidate :
                low = middle + 1
        
        return letters[low]
