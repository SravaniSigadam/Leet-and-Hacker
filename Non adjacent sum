You are a thief trying to steal from houses in a neighborhood. The amount of money that can be stolen from the ith house is represented by nums[i]. 
While youâ€™d like to steal from all the houses, if adjacent houses are broken into, the police are notified via a security system. 
Return the largest amount of money you can steal without alerting the police.
Note: You may not modify nums.
Ex: Given the following nums...

def thief(nums):
    first = nums[0]
    second = nums[1]
    for i in range(2,len(nums)-1):
        if i%2 == 0:
            second+=nums[i]
        first+=nums[i]
    if first > second:
        return first
    return second
