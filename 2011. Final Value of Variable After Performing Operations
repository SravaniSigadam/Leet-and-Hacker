#There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

#++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
#--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
#Initially, the value of X is 0.

#Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

#Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"] Output: 1
