# Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4 Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
# Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters. Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

class Solution:
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        s = s.replace("-",'').upper()
        rem = len(s) % k
        firstGroup = [s[:rem]]
        secondGroup = [s[i:i+k] for i in range(rem,len(s),k)]
        if rem:
            return "-".join(firstGroup+secondGroup) 
        return "-".join(secondGroup)
