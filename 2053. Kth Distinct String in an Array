# A distinct string is a string that is present only once in an array.

# Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. 
# If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string "".

# Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.
# Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2 Output: "a"

class Solution:
    def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:
        d = {}
        new = []
        for i in arr:
            d[i] = d.get(i,0) + 1
        for key,val in d.items():
            if val==1:
                new.append(key)
        if len(new) > 0 and len(new) >= k:
            return new[k-1]
        else:
            return ""
